# Mark's Traefik Install for Docker

This is my default Traefik setup using HTTP and HTTPS entrypoints, Docker and File dynamic configurations, Let's Encrypt to provide certificates, and the built-in dashboard for validating configuration.

## Purpose

This is meant to be the starting point for routing my docker based application installs. This should make it easier than my previous solution of running Nginx with custom configuration files and docker host port configs.
